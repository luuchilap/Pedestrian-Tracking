This project detailed in the PDF file focuses on "Object Tracking" within the realm of computer vision.

The primary aim is to build a pedestrian tracking system using a combination of the YOLOv8 (You Only Look Once) model for object detection and the DeepSORT (Simple Online and Realtime Tracking with a Deep Association Metric) algorithm for tracking.
